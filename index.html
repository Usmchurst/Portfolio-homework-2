       <h2>About Me</h2>  
        <article> 
            <p>
              My name is Eric Hurst and I am 44 years old and I am from los Angeles California. At an early age I was interested in auto mechanics. From the age that I was able to walk my father put a tool in my hand.
              My father taught me how to work on vehicles at an early age. As I grew older, I stared working on may parents cars when my father was working or was not able to. In addition, my father had me work on his 
              streed racing car so that he could race when he came home from work. During that time growing up I was very interested in military operations and weapons. During high school I found the ROTC program and joined, 
              as a result I joind and liked the program. I attended until I graduated high school and went straight into the U.S. Marines. After 20 years of serving as a engineer equipment Cheif I retired.
              Upon retiring I finished my Bachelors degree and stared working as a VP of IDB, a water filtration company that provided warer filtration components to the U.S Government, municipalites and vending machines
              companies aroundthe world. After three years of working for IDB I started my own chemical manufacturing company and have been building this company ever since.
